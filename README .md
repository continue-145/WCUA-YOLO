Enhanced Fabric Defect Detection using WCUA-YOLO: Integrating Comprehensive Feature Extraction and Multi-Scale Fusion
# Abstract
Fabric surface defect detection is crucial for ensuring product quality in the textile industry. However, the complexity of fabric defects and industrial environment interference pose significant challenges to accurate detection. This paper presents the WCUA-YOLO model, an enhancement of the YOLOv8 architecture specifically designed for fabric defect detection. The model incorporates the WIoU loss function to optimize detection performance, the CUConv module to enhance feature extraction, and the CSSF module to effectively fuse multi-scale features. Additionally, the ASFF-Head detection head further improves detection accuracy while maintaining feature scale consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on customized and public datasets demonstrate that WCUA-YOLO achieves superior performance with mAP values of 93.8% and 51.4%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. These results validate the effectiveness and reliability of WCUA-YOLO in fabric defect detection, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.
